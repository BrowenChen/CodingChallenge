===============

Try to consistently push to git as much as possible. 

Small, incremental, but consistent practice is the way to accomplish anything. Thats the best lesosn I've gotten out of 6-7 years as an endurance athlete. Goal is to try and push to git everyday, even if it's a little bit just to build that habit. Future habit making app idea possible as well.

If other repo's aren't updated, ill do a coding question and update here
