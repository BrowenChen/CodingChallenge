Coding
===============

Try to consistently push to git as much as possible. 

If other repo's aren't updated, ill do a coding question and update here. Random stuff here and there

Small, incremental, but consistent practice. Goal is to try and push to git everyday, even if it's a little bit just to build that habit. Future habit making app idea possible as well.
